# credit-risk-classification

Introduction
  - For this weeks challenge we are tasked with using various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk.
  - The information we are using is from a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Part 1
  - To start we will split the data into training and testing sets, create a logistic regression model with the origional data, and write a credit risk analysis report.
  - Before splitting the datasets, you will need to read in the lending_data.csv into a Pandas DataFrame.
  - After the dataset is read in you need to create the labels set from the "loan_status" column, and then create the features DataFram from the remaining columns.

Part 2
  - After the dataset is split into testing and training sets, you will need to create a logistic regression model with the original data.
  - You will need to fit a regression model using the training data, save the predictions, and evaluate the models performance through a confusion matrix and classification report.

Analysis
  - Once both parts are completed, a credit risk analysis report is needed.
  - In this report provide an overview of the analysis, the results, and a summary of the findings.
